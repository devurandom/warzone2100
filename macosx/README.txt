Welcome to Warzone 2100 on MacOS X.  To install the game, simply drag
the Warzone application bundle icon from the mounted disk image to a
location on your hard drive.  You can then eject and throw away the
disk image.  To run the game, simply double-click the Warzone icon
on your hard drive.

When you run the program, it will create a directory named .warzone-2.0
in your home directory.  You can control settings such as the screen
resolution in the 'config' file within that directory.  The setting to
change the screen resolution is 'resolution=<setting>'.  To run in
fullscreen mode, change the 'fullscreen=0' line to read 'fullscreen=1'.

This program is distributed as a self-contained application bundle.
It should run without requiring any additional software on MacOS X
10.3 "Panther" and 10.4 "Tiger" on the PowerPC platform.
