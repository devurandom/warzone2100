<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Why NTW?&nbsp; N = New, T = Team & W = War. In the old Warzone days was 1 Map very popular, Team War (TW). Today we play New Team War (NTW). This Map is inside the NTW Mod + my Map NTW ver2. -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Tiger class (faster, a bit more armor & less costs too) &  Dragon are faster but a bit slower than Python (class). Wyvern is a bit faster than Python. VTOL Weapons are not so strong (bombs are a bit better than before) and Cyborg Weapons are stronger (like the Tank Weapons). Combat Engineer & Cyborg Mechanic do there job better too now. -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Heavy Pulse Laser and Plasma Cannon are useful now (longer range, more damage, good vs Buildings). -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced AA Laser in Tank Killer Laser (Tank Killer Laser Defends got the same range like Scourge Missile Defends good vs Tanks and bad vs Buildings). It is better than Railgun and almost good like Gauss. -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced HPV Cannon in Twin Heavy Cannon (good vs Tanks). Its not like this one in 1.11 or 1.12 Patch! You need Heavy Cannon, HVAPFSDS Cannon Rounds Mk1, Cannon Autoloader Mk1 for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Replaced Incenediary Mortar in Super Twin Cannon (a good anti Tank Weapon again). Its a bit better than Rail Gun but cost more. You need Twin Heavy Cannon and Cannon Rapid Loader Mk3 for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Another new Weapon is the Heavy Gauss Cannon. Its Heavyer than Gauss, got a slower reload, cost more and you need more time to produce it. But it do more Damage and got more Durability. Research Gauss Cannon for it. -</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000>- Nexus Link shoot during moving and you can build his Tower faster with lower costs (only Nexus Tower). Plasma Cannon Emplacement got the right Research Menu Icon now and Scorpion Body (VTOL and Wheels Bug) is repaired. -</FONT></P>
