/** @mainpage Warzone2100 Code Documentation
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the Warzone2100 Resurrection Project's code library! We are still only starting
 * to document this code base, but it should already be useful for quickly browsing around the
 * code and getting an idea of what exists and how things work.
 *
 * @section install_sec Where to begin
 *
 * @subsection step1 Step 1: Read the wiki documentation
 *
 * We have a great deal of documentation on our wiki page at http://wiki.wz2100.net/ which
 * may help get you started. Please also take notice of our style guide!
 *
 * @subsection step2 Step 2: Skim main.c
 *
 * You may want to begin reading code with main.c, since this is where execution begins,
 * and trace code paths from here.
 *
 * Have fun!
