1. Contents of Warzone 2100 GPL
===============================
Warzone 2100, released in 1999 and developed by Pumpkin Studios,
was a groundbreaking and innovative 3D real-time strategy game.
In 2004 Eidos, in collaboration with Pumpkin Studios, decided to release
the source for the game under the terms of the GNU GPL, including everything
but the music and in-game video sequences.

Additionally all multiplayer-maps that were available in Warzone 2100 1.10,
the last official patch by Pumpkin Studios, are available in Warzone 2100 GPL as
well.

2. State of the game
====================
After the liberation of the Warzone 2100 source-code on December 6th, 2004, all
proprietary technologies had been replaced with open-source-counterparts.

Right now supported platforms are GNU/Linux, Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and Windows
(98 - XP). There are reports that Warzone 2100 GPL is working on BSD, too. Some
people even run it under Windows Vista, which is not directly supported.

The game is still in a beta-state, so do not expect the game to run without any
issues.

2.1 Reporting Bugs
------------------
This game still has bugs and if you run into one, please use the bugtracker
(https://gna.org/bugs/?group=warzone) to report this bug. In order to faster fix
those bugs the developers require that you follow these rules:

   1. If the game crashes you may save a memory dump. Please do so and upload it
      when reporting the bug. (Linux locates that file at /tmp/warzone2100.gdmp)
      A self created backtrace is just as useful.
   2. Give as much information about what you were doing before the crash/bug
      occured.
   3. Try to reproduce the bug and add a description of the process to your bug-
      report.
   4. You may even upload save-games. These consist of one or two file(s) and
      one folder. All two/three are named after your save-game (e.g.
      MySaveGame.es, MySaveGame.gam and the folder MySaveGame).
   5. Bug-reports are no submit-&-forget-reports. It may be that you forgot some
      information or forgot to upload a file. So it is, too, in your interest to
      watch the bug-report after it has been submitted. Additionally you receive
      e-mails of comments to your bug-report.

3. Configuration
================
3.1 WZ-dir and configuration file
---------------------------------
Warzone saves your configuration data in a file named "config". Where this file
is located depends on your operating system.

Warzone-dir under GNU/Linux
***************************
Under GNU/Linux the warzone-dir can be found in your home-directory, it's called
".warzone2100". The leading dot indicates that it is a hidden folder so
depending on your configuration you may not be able to see it. However, you can
still access it by typing the path into your address-bar.

Warzone-dir under Windows
*************************
The folder is called "Warzone 2100" and is located in "My Documents".

3.2 Command-line options
------------------------
Additionally to the configuration-file Warzone can be started with different
parameters.

Note: This parameters all have two dashes (--), not one dash only (-). Trying to
use the parameters with one dash only will not work.
Parameter			Effect
--fullscreen 			play in fullscreen-mode
--window 			play in windowed mode
--resolution WIDTHxHEIGHT 	sets the size of the viewport, usable with
				fullscreen and windowed
--datadir DIR 			sets the default data-dir to DIR
--shadows 			enables shadows
--noshadows 			disables shadows
--sound 			enables sound
--nosound 			disables sound
--cheat 			enables the usage of cheats and debug-keys

Note: All mentioned command-line parameters except --datadir change the appro-
priate value in your config-file. Starting warzone by double-clicking the exe-
cutable/binary will then start the game with the settings used last time. So
don't wonder, if there is no sound, when you started warzone with --nosound last
time.

Note: This is list is not complete. A complete list and further information on
command-line options (http://wiki.wz2100.net/command_line_options) can be found
at the Wiki of Warzone Resurrection Project (http://wiki.wz2100.net/).

3.3 Music
---------
As the original game music is part of the data that was not liberated, we are
reintroducing music, but in a different way. We use a playlist system that can
point to any *.ogg or *.mp3-file in your warzone-data-path. This is still
experimental and we are gradually making this more usable.

Warzone reads the following two playlists (in the order they are mentioned) and
the first playlist found will be used:

* Warzone-directory in your personal directory:
	o for GNU/Linux: ~/.warzone2100/music/music.wpl
	o for Windows: ~/My Documents/Warzone 2100/music/music.wpl
* Warzone-install-path:
	o <whereverwarzoneisinstalled>/music/music.wpl

Using the playlist
******************
The playlist contains two sections, [game] and [menu]. For each section you can
define a list of songs you want to played in-game. Supported file-formats are
OGG and MP3 as long as all necessary libraries are installed.

With "shuffle=yes" you specify that you want the songs to played in random
order. You need to set this for each section individually.

Using "path=." you specify that the following files are found in the folder the
playlist was found. If you do not specify a path all file-names have to be given
with "absolute" path. This "absolute" path is still relative to your
warzone-data-dir. All file-names should be lower-case. However file-names have
to match those in the file-system.

This example shows how a playlist-file could look like:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[game]
path=.
shuffle=yes
neos_aurore.ogg
neos_chocolat.ogg
neos_down.ogg
neos_esperance.ogg
neos_indy.ogg

[menu]
path=.
neos_symphonie_du_vide.ogg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4 Multiplaying via internet
-----------------------------
There are two methods to start a multiplayer-game via internet: using the host's
IP or using the lobby-server. Make sure to be able to communicate on TCP-ports
9998 and 9999.

You can choose whether to connect via Lobby or IP:

* If you choose IP, Warzone 2100 asks you for the ip-address of the host and
  will try to connect to that IP.
* If you choose Lobby, Warzone 2100 will connect to the lobby server, as long as
  the lobby-server-address in your config-file has not been changed.

You will see a list of games from which you can select one.

You can kick unwanted players out of not-yet-started game by clicking left on
them while holding the right mouse button.

When you are hosting a game it will automatically be listed on the lobby-server.
If you do not want your games to be listed on the lobby-server, you have to
change the entry "masterserver_name=lobby.wz2100.net" in your config to some-
thing invalid as "nomasterserverplease".

If you then want to see the games that are listed on the lobby-server you may
enter "lobby.wz2100.net" when prompted to enter the host's IP or change the
entry in the config-file back. You will have to restart Warzone 2100 in order
for config-changes to take effect.
