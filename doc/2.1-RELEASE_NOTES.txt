These are some release notes describing the current state of 2.1.

New (notable) features:
 * Internationalisation/Translation support by means of gettext
 * Multi-turret support for droids (i.e. tanks and cyborgs) and structures
 * Video options menu; allows selecting of (among others) the screen resolution and windowed/fullscreen mode
 * A new mini-map mode: the heightmap (use CTRL+TAB to cycle through mini-map modes)
 * Stock AI greatly improved
 * Additional AI provided: Aivolution
 * 64-bit compatibility! Warzone now runs on systems with 64 bit processors, kernels and libraries as well!

Known issues:
 * The multiplayer code has become a __lot__ more stable than it was, but running out of sync still happens. Though it now happens less often and the sync differences are smaller.
 * The game in general still crashes a lot in debug builds (due to failed assertions).
 * Text is not always drawn correctly on Mac OSX systems.
 * Savegames from the 2.0 series can __not__ be loaded with this version. (And currently there are no plans of supporting 2.0 savegames).
 * Terrain texture is known to fail from time to time (which will cause the entire terrain to show up white).
