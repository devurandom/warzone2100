- Add a shadow toggle to src/clparse.c
- bug #5097: CPU Hog
	Reduce the amount of main-loop-runs to a reasonable number (eg 50),
	so we don't eat up the whole CPU time.
	Advanced code could be taken from the SDL_gfx project (http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/).
	The really simple solution would be a kind of SDL_Delay(1000/FPS).
	
	Framerate calculation currently takes place in lib/framework/frame.c:103+
	Main loop resides in src/main.c:486+
