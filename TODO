Easy:

- Add an option to directly host or join a multiplay game to src/clparse.c

- Make Warzone respond to the SDL_QUIT event so it can be closed with ^C, ALT+F4 or closing the window.
    This involves registering all needed functions to atexit() so Warzone shuts down properly on that event.

- Fix memleaks in lexer files. Appears in functions like strres_ensure_buffer_stack or strres__create_buffer.

- Add the ability to pause music (from the user playlists) with a keybind

More difficult:

- Display "backdrops" instead of novideo.rpl so a story can be told using subtitles and be illustrated with pictures.

- Create one single place where platform dependend defines reside.

- [separation] Work out an engine part (lib/) and a game part (src/),
    where no engine part depends on any game part

- [separation2] Separate the engine parts so they have only a minimum dependency on each other
    and rearrange them logically (depends on [separation])

- Improve the menus for usability (esp. networking)

- Improve loading of data / dataformat. Should be possible to load all maps
    in all techlevels for campaign as well as multiplay mode. This would hopefully
    fix those bugs where maps are missing or the campaign breaks because of maps.
    Would involve modification of data and YaCC/Lex files.

- Revise input handling to support multiple keymaps.

- Try getting QuesoGLC accepted into one of Debian's repositories since our Debian package depends on it;
    An RFP (Request For Packaging) is already existent in Debian's bugtracker:
