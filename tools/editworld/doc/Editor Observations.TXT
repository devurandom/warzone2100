1	Is it possible to use two keys to rotate the map in the 3d view around the center of the 
	view ?
2	Can an UNDO command be put in ?
3	When a tile is rotated  and then flipped , the 3d map view doesn't update until the camera 
	moves off and comes back.
4	Pressing X in the top right hand corner of the window should prompt the user with a 
	" Save Untitled.Ind ?" type message.
5	When painting a texture , the screen should scroll as the mose moves towards the edge of the 
	window.
6	We need to be able to select an area and auto fill it with the selected texture.
7	Also , if rotate texture is selected  and the mouse is left clicked within a selected area 
	ALL the tiles in that area should be rotated.
