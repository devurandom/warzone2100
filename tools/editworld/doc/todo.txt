BattleTech editor
=================

*Things To Do, Suggestions and Miscelaneous Brain Farts!*

Stats and Object Database
-------------------------

* Add boolean data type to stats template code.
* Modify stats and object type template parsers to make templates more readable.
* Loading 3d object (userobject3d) with same object name as an already loaded predefined data type (icon) can't be done , this should be possible.
* Always give new instances of objects independant stats.
* (DONE) Each object needs a unique unit ID.
* Waypoints, need to be able to add multiple waypoints to the database , each one being a group and each instance defining the path. Could apply to any object type , need a USEMULTIPLE flag in the object type script.
* (DONE) Remove deployment template entry from object types script as all objects will now use the same deployment template.
* (DONE) Remove deployment stats from object database. Will now be handled by force lists.

Force Lists (Deployment Lists)
------------------------------

* (DONE) Deployment stats need to have sequence field for handling deployment waves.
* (DONE) Need to display / edit deployment list (force list) as table with one unit per row.
* (DONE) Need to always sort by sequence (wave) field.
* (DONE) Need to be able to sort stats by time field.
* (DONE) Need to be able to select from list of unit id's for some fields.
* Event triggers , find out what editor needs to be able to do with regards to these (Richard).
* (DONE) Need to implement save/load.
* (DONE) Need to delete entry from force list if object instance is deleted.
* (DONE) Need to delete all references to object in force list if it's parent object is deleted.

General
-------

* Placing objects which are spot lights , setting intensity , radius. always face downwards but center can be offset from parent.
* (DONE) Menu option to reset heights of all objects ie after changing heights.
* Selection of multiple objects.
* Editing ambient light.
* Editing directional light.
* X/Z flipping of tile textures. (see suggestion)
* 90 degree rotation of tile textures. (see suggestion)
* Save height map as grey scale PCX bitmap.
* Separate landscape data and object database into two files.
* Convert landscape file to use binary format instead of text to save on disk space and loading time.
* Need to be able to output w+1 by h+1 size height maps since a 128 by 128 tile map actually has 129 by 129 vertices.
* Need to be able to use multiple texture pages. This will be made easier (hopefully) when we get the beta release of DX5 with the "finished" DrawPrimitive API.
* Tie objects to ground so that when ground height changes , object are repositioned automaticly.
* Save map segments.
* Load maps segments or smaller maps and stitch into larger maps.
* (DONE) Keyboard shortcut for changing camera altitude.
* (DONE) Keyboard shortcut for changing camera angle.
* Button to cycle through views of all instances of currently selected object.
* Tool to set all tiles below sea level with a given texture.
* Allow flipping of tile areas.
* 2D objects (Sprites).
* Field in template to specify sprite file.
* Undo (texture painting)
* Undo (paste)
* Update documentation.

Known Bugs
----------

* Fix "New Project" bug.
* (DONE) Fix bug where you can't always place objects , especially in large (256x256) maps.
* (DONE) Fix strange texture bug which only happens on Mark C's machine ( 4MB Mystique PP200 ) Seems to be trying to do mip mapping even thought I've not told it to.
* (DONE) If you delete all the objects from the database view then scroll the view , will cause a crash.
* (DONE) Loaded landscape , did new , loaded landscape , did add object , crashed.
* (DONE) Loaded landscape , deleted object , did add object , crashed selecting object type.
* (DONE) 3d locator map dos'nt work properly if in drag object mode.
* Locking camera altitude may cause problems with different height scales.
* Object selection dos'nt work in 3d view on some MMX machines ( using emulation I think , Driver bug? ).
* Crashes sometimes drawing radar map , invalid DIB section. could be something to do with size?
* (DONE) Problem loading 256 x 256 maps.
* (DONE) GetHeight dos'nt always work properly.

Misc. Suggestions
-----------------

* (DONE) The ability to drag heights etc. with the textures still on.
* Another level off zoom out for the 2-D map.
* (NO) A larger 3-D window.
* (DONE) The ability to clip the 3-D view with more showing on screen, (for faster PC's)
* Light source on/off
* (DONE) Increase/Decrease Altitude in the 3D view
* (DONE) Direction keys to move about the 3D view, maybe use the Numeric Pad with 9 and 7 keys to increase and decrease the altitude
* (DONE) Keyboard to raise , lower sea level.
* (DONE) Make sea level scaled by height scaling so always in range 0 - 255 , this will tie it in better to the landscape geometry which is always 0-255 * height scale.
* Light source needs to reflect height scale.
* Could you have the editor set up so that when the player right clicks on the texture it will rotate, and the 'F' key flips the texture (before it has been selected from the texture selection box).  One other thing could you put a key in to default the texture settings in the texture selection box.
