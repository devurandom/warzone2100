FIXES:
- search_depth option for pie_import.py which will keep looking in parent dirs
	until it finds ./texpages.
- looks like model needs to be mirrored on x axis to be correct.
- still need info about one poly referencing the same point multiple times

NEW:
- add a separate validation script and run it implicitly at the start of an
	export op.
- add conf file to configure import/export vertex/poly maximums
- coords of exported pies should be relative to their parent, and not the
	scene. make sure this holds true. (shouldn't be a problem. make sure anyways)
- add a pie_animate script to handle teamcolors and animation -- clone of pie
	slicer's functionality.
- add snap-to options for dealing with multiple pies with connectors as a
	separate script.
- along with snap-to, try to auto-detect the model's function (turret, body,
	etc) based on file path and name, but always giving the option to select
- add an import option that allows the user to skip the texpage selection
	screen if the right texpage was found.

NEW (low priority):
- add dirty mesh support.
- add gridlines if possible: determined values to be .512 spacing, 6 lines
	(the blender -> python api doesn't seem to support setting these yet)
- add translation support
